DESCRIPTION:
    This script uses the bogglesolver module to generate solutions to the
    boggle grids entered by a user.  The bogglesolver's internal dictionary is
    created once when the object is initialized.  It is then reused for
    subsequent solution searches.

    The user is prompted to input a string of x*y characters, representing the
    letters in a X by Y Boggle grid.  Use the letter 'q' to represent "qu".

    For example: "qadfetriihkriflv" represents the 4x4 grid::

     +---+---+---+---+
     | Qu| A | D | F |
     +---+---+---+---+
     | E | T | R | I |
     +---+---+---+---+
     | I | H | K | R |
     +---+---+---+---+
     | I | F | L | V |
     +---+---+---+---+

    The default reference dictionary is included boggle_dict.txt, which is used
    if no dictionary is specified on the command line.  This dictionary
    includes plurals to words, which most dictionaries do not.
